# Testing

## Test problems

The directory `qubos` contains a set of problems with known optimal energies. 
`qbsTest_bqp_Target.sh` should run a suite of these problems.

## Unit tests

The unit tests are built using the [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) 
library. Currently the unit tests have a fairly low coverage.
